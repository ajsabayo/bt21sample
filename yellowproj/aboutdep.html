		<h1> What is Depression? </h1>
		<br>
			<p>
			Depression is more than just feeling 'down'.
			<br>
			Depression is a real illness that impacts the brain. Anyone suffering from depression will tell you, it's not imaginary or 'all in your head.' It is a serious illness caused by changes in brain chemistry. Research tells us that other factors contribute to the onset of depression, including genetics, changes in hormone levels, certain medical conditions, stress, grief or difficult life circumstances. Any of these factors alone or in combination can precipitate changes in brain chemistry that lead to depression's many symptoms. 
			<br>
			Depression does not discriminate. Men and women of every age, educational level, and social and economic background suffer from depression. There is no area of life that does not suffer when depression is present. Marriage, parenting, friendships, careers, finances, every aspect of daily living is compromised by this disease. Once an episode of depression occurs, it is also quite likely that it will recur. And the impact of depression can be even more severe when it occurs in combination with other medical illnesses such as diabetes, stroke, or cardiovascular disease, or with related disorders such as anxiety or substance abuse.

		<h1> Kinds of Depression </h1>
			<ul>
				<li> Major Depression </li>	
				<p> Major depression is sometimes called major depressive disorder, clinical depression, unipolar depression or simply 'depression'. It involves low mood and/or loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities, as well as other symptoms. The symptoms are experienced most days and last for at least two weeks. Symptoms of depression interfere with all areas of a person's life, including work and social relationships. Depression can be described as mild, moderate or severe; melancholic or psychotic (see below).</p>
				<br>

				<li> Melancholia</li>	
				<p> This is the term used to describe a severe form of depression where many of the physical symptoms of depression are present. One of the major changes is that the person starts to move more slowly. They're also more likely to have a depressed mood that is characterised by complete loss of pleasure in everything, or almost everything. </p>
				<br>

				<li> Psychotic Depression </li>	
				<p> There are times people with a depressive disorder can lose touch with reality and experience psychosis. This can involve hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) or delusions (false beliefs that aren't shared by others).</p>
				<br>

				<li> Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) </li>	
				<p> SAD is a mood disorder that has a seasonal pattern. It's characterised by mood disturbances (either periods of depression or mania) that begin and end in a particular season.</p>

		<article class="col-3">
			<ul>
				<li> Antenatal and Postnatal Depression </li>	
				<p> In the days immediately following birth, many women experience the baby blues which is a common condition related to hormonal changes and affects up to 80 per cent of women. The baby blues , or general stress adjusting to pregnancy and/or a new baby, are common experiences, but are different from depression. Depression is longer lasting and can affect not only the mother, but her relationship with her baby, the child's development, the mother's relationship with her partner and with other members of the family. </p>
				<br>

				<li> Bipolar Disorder </li>	
				<p> Bipolar disorder seems to be most closely linked to family history. Stress and conflict can trigger episodes for people with this condition and it's not uncommon for bipolar disorder to be misdiagnosed as depression, alcohol or drug abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia.Diagnosis depends on the person having had an episode of mania and, unless observed, this can be hard to pick. It is not uncommon for people to go for years before receiving an accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. </p>
				<br>

				<li> Dysthymic Disorder </li>	
				<p> The symptoms of dysthymia are similar to those of major depression but are less severe. However, in the case of dysthymia, symptoms last longer. A person has to have this milder depression for more than two years to be diagnosed with dysthymia. </p>
